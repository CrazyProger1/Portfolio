        I'm third year student of <span className='text-info'>Kharkiv National University of Economics</span>,
        majoring in <span className='text-info'>Computer Science.</span> I have
        always been interested in technology and have spent <span
        className='text-info'>5 years studying programming</span>.
        I have tried many programming languages such as <span className='text-info'>Python, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin and even NASM</span>.
        But my first and favorite language is Python, so my goal is a <span
