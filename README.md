# Portfolio

My Portfolio as a Python Developer.

I'm third year student of **Kharkiv National University of Economics**, majoring in **Computer Science**. I have always been
interested in technology and have spent **5 years studying programming**. I have tried many programming languages such as
**Python, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin and even NASM**. But my first and favorite language is Python, so my goal is a
**Python Developer role** on an interesting and challenging project.
